# Indonesian Doctors in Germany

More than 11% of all registered doctors in Germany come from countries outside the EU. More than 6000 Syrian doctors now work in Germany, many of whom come after the Syrian civil war. In recent years the numbers of foreign doctors are increasing rapidly. More than 4000 additional foreign doctors have been registered in 2023 alone.

## Specialist Training Free of Charge

The main attraction for Indonesian doctors looking to work in Germany is the fact that virtually all doctors in Germany will undergo specialist training at some point in their career and said training is completely free of charge. This stands in stark contrast to Indonesia where specialist training is extremely limited and competitive. So much so that female and minorities doctors will have to face the reality that they are very unlikely to ever be a specialist.

## Requirements to Work as Doctors in Germany

Doctors from outisde the EU has to receive the so called "Approbation" in order to be able to work in Germany. The exact requirement is slightly different in each state (Bundesland) and doctors are to [contact the state's medical association](https://www.bundesaerztekammer.de/fileadmin/user_upload/BAEK/Themen/Aus-Fort-Weiterbildung/Ausbildung/Liste_Approbationsbehoerden_final_230424.pdf). We have partners in Germany with whom the Indonesian doctors can consult so that they will get their work visa.

From the moment an applicant consult with us and start the process of migration to Germany it will take 6-12 months before he or she can fly to Germany and start working as doctor there. We will help with the recognition process (also known as *Anerkennung* and *Approbation* in German), finding the most suitable employer, finalizing the work contract, help with visa and work permit and finally we can help with finding accomodation and help applicants in their first week in Germany.

By far the most extensive part of the preparation learning German. Therefore applicant should start learning German as soon as possible while other steps such as job application, recognition application, visa, work permit and so on **should be done in parallel** otherwise the entire process will take even longer. Right after arrival in Germany applicant will start working as an assistant doctor. This is the same grade/title as other recent graduates from German medical school. While he or she is working as doctors, applicant must also attend a German course as well as a special course for foreign doctors in order to pass both the German language exam as well as the medical doctor state exam.

Once the applicant passes both exams he or she will be considered as fully recognized doctor in Germany. From then on he or she can work independently as doctor. Also if the applicant is a specialist, he can start the process to get his specialist title recognized.

In the next images we will try to explain each process in greater detail.
