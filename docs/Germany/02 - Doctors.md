# Chronic shortage of doctors in Germany

![Statistics of foreign doctors](/img/Arztestatistik.png)

As of December 2023 there about 64.000 doctors from outside Germany currently works there. Of those, only 24 thousand doctors come from the EU  while the rest come from all over the world including from Asia which stands at 17 thousand doctors. There are currently 457 doctors from Indonesia working in Germany, 37 of those have just started last year.

Recruitment of doctors from outside the EU are being pursued as hospitals and clinics in Germany are chronically understaffed by both doctors and nurses. **In 2023 there are 98.755 open position for medical doctors**. The reason being that MDs often decide to no longer pursue their career as doctors. More than 140 thousand German doctors decided to stop working as doctors. They switch to other profession, take parental leave (which can be up to several years), become full time stay at home parent and various other reasons. This chronic shortage of doctors is projected to increase even further as there are more than 97.000 doctors currently are 60 years old or older.

## Specialist Training Free of Charge

The main attraction for Indonesian doctors looking to work in Germany is the fact that virtually all doctors in Germany will undergo specialist training at relatively early point in their career and said specialist training is completely free of charge. This stands in stark contrast to Indonesia where specialist training is extremely limited and competitive. So much so that female and minorities doctors will have to face the reality that they are very unlikely to ever be a specialist.

## Requirements to Work as Doctors in Germany

There are two main ways to work as doctors in Germany:

### Temporary Work Permit (Berufserlaubnis)

A temporary work permit (*Berufserlaubnis*) for up to two years can be granted to Indonesian doctors. During these two years, the doctors will be permitted to work as GP however they must also strive toward acquiring a permanent work permit (*Approbation*). In practice this means in addition to working as doctors, they are also to attend language and medical exam preparation courses.

### Permanent Work Permit as Doctor (Approbation)

Doctors from outisde the EU can get full and permanent recognition as medical doctors by obtaining the so called "Approbation". The exact requirement for approbation is slightly different in each state (Bundesland) and doctors are to [contact the state's medical association](https://www.bundesaerztekammer.de/fileadmin/user_upload/BAEK/Themen/Aus-Fort-Weiterbildung/Ausbildung/Liste_Approbationsbehoerden_final_230424.pdf).

The agency responsible to give Approbation will examine each doctor's application individually. Among other things the education curriculum and work experience will be compared to the german medical school's curriculum. Virtually in all cases for Indonesia medical school there will be the so called "wesentliche Unterschiede" that is **essential differences** between the two curriculums. To prove that these essential differences have been addressed, the doctors will need to pass a state exam aka "*Kenntnisprüfung*". This exam is the same exam that medical students in Germany have to pass in order to receive their MD title.

The necessity of passing the exam is why Indonesian doctors are strongly advised to take the medical exam preparation course. In some states attending the preparatory course is even mandatory.

### German Language

To receive a temporary work permit a German language certificate at level B2 is needed. Indonesian doctors are to be advised to start their language training as soon as possible as reaching this level of proficiency may take up to one year of even more.

While working as doctors in Germany, a language course is to be attended by the doctors as well. The reason being that a C1 German proficiency is required to receive Approbation. 

### Summary

To get temporary work permit:

- MD title
- Health and psychological check
- B2 proficiency in German

To get permanent work permit:

- Pass the *Kenntnisprüfung*
