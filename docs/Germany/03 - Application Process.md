## Steps towards Approbation

From the moment an applicant consult with us and start the process of migration to Germany it will take 6-12 months before he or she can fly to Germany and start working as doctor there. We will help with the recognition process (also known as *Anerkennung* and *Approbation* in German), finding the most suitable employer, scheduling interview, finalizing the work contract, help with visa and work permit as well as finding accomodation and accompanying applicants in their first week in Germany.

By far the most extensive part of the preparation is learning German.

Therefore applicant should start learning German as soon as possible while other steps such as job application, recognition application, visa, work permit and so on **should be done in parallel** otherwise the entire process will take even longer. Right after arrival in Germany applicant will start working as an assistant doctor. This is the same grade/title as other recent graduates from German medical school. While he or she is working as doctors, applicant must also attend a C1 German course as well as an exam preparatory course.

Once the applicant passes both exams he or she will be considered as fully recognized doctor in Germany. From then on he or she can work independently as doctor. Also if the applicant is a specialist, he can start the process to get his specialist title recognized.

In the next images we will try to explain each process in greater detail.

## 1. First Consultation and Finding an employer

Talk to us ! We'd like to know more about your educational background, work experience and so on. We'd also like to know what kind of work, hospital, city and specialization that you are considering. Each doctor have their own needs and preferences. Most likely a curriculum from your medical school will be required, we will consult you on what needs to be described in the curriculum so your application will be accepted by the state's medical association.

In order to get a work visa you will need a job offer as doctors. We will help you connect with hospitals and clinics in Germany and setup a virtual interview . Should you be accepted, a job offer and a work contract will be sent to you. We can help you with understanding what is contained within the contract.

## 2. Apply for Recognition

By having a job offer, you can now apply for a temporary work permit. To get it you must also apply for a permanent work permit (Approbation). We can help you communicate with the medical association as to what documents are needed, which one can be in English and which one has to be translated to German, etc.

## 3. Understanding and Fulfilling Recognition Requirement

Not only are Approbation requirements differ in each state, they are also personalized to each doctor's education and work experience. We can help you with understanding which additional classes you might need to take, which additional work experience you will need to show, which preparatory courses you might need in order to be able to pass the state exam and get a permanent work permit.

## 4. Applying to the courses and finding accomodation

Now that you know which courses to take in order to get Approbation, we can contact the local course provider so that they will reserve a place for you.In addition, now that we know where you will work and when you will start working, we will also help you with finding accomodation. Having a place to stay is also a requirement for your visa.

## 5. Apply for Visa and Fly to Germany

There are various types of visa, each has its own pros and cons. For doctors, we'd most likely recommend you to get the EU Blue Card which has a more stringent requirement i.e. "a higher professional qualifications" but also has a host of advantages compared to normal visa. EU Blue Card has more stringent requirements and generally longer processing time so at times other type of visa might be preferable. We can also help you with booking a flight ticket as well as arrange people to receive you at the airport and accompany you in your first week in Germany.

## 6. Language and Exam Prep Courses

From the time you are granted a temporary work permit, you have up to two years to complete the Approbation requirements. Therefore selecting and enrolling in a language course specialized in Medical Technical Language Exam as well as state exam preparatory course should be done as soon as possible. We can help with selecting the right course and with the enrollment.

## 7. Obligatory report 

In yor first week in Germany there will be a lot of things that need to be done. Reporting to the Indonesian consulate. Opening a bank account. Enrolling yourself to a health insurance. Register yourself to the town hall. These and many other things have to be done as soon as possible to avoid late fine as well as non-compliance to rules and regulations.

## 8. Visit your accomodation

Your first week could be rather stressful as there are many things need to be done in order to make your apartment feels like home. Learning how to use the public transporation system. How to pay your rent. How to do banking in Germany. Getting a German SIM card. We can help with these and many other things 

## 9. Start working in the clinic or hospital of your choice

Finally! Time to meet your co-workers. The hospital will likely take over of everything from this point on. But we're always just one whatsapp message away!.
