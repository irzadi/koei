## Why is my medical school curriculum needed?

Your medical school’s curriculum will be thoroughly examined in order to check whether there are essential differences between German and Indonesian curriculum by the state’s medical doctor association. This is the same organization which is authorized to give you a permanent work permit as a medical doctor.

## Do I need to have my documents translated to German?

Every document that is not already in German will need to be translated.The translation is only valid if done by specially appointed, chartered and sworn translators in Germany. In order to reduce cost, it might be possible to have some documents translated locally in Indonesia by translators who are appointed by the German Embassy to do so. Talk to us first so we can discuss it with the state's medical association to see if it possible to have some documents translation in Indonesia.

It might be possible at some state to have the med school curriculum in English.

## What do I have to do if I move to another Bundesland (province/state)?

Unfortunately you will need to take back your Approbation application and then apply for another Approbation at the new state's medical association.

## Is Approbation valid throughout all of Germany?

Yes!  
Not only in Germany but the whole of European Union and in Switzerland.

## How should the curriculum look like ?

The curriculum can only be recognized if it is :

- personalized to you
- complete with description of what is learned, where and how long (hourly)
- in English
- or in Indonesian but with a German translation attached
- must be authorized and approved by the University. The letter of approval must be stamped by the University.

## How long does Work Permit and/or Approbation process take?

Due to high volume of workload, it could take weeks before your application is even seen and start to be processed.

Temporary work permit process usually takes **at least six weeks**.

Approbation process for doctors educated outside the EU **can take more than one year**. Since your work permit is only valid for up to two years applying for Approbation as soon as possible is imperative.

## How much does the work permit and/or Approbation application cost?

In general it costs between 1000-2000 Euro. However in most cases, you can bargain with the hospitals or clinics where you will work so that they will cover the cost for you.

## Which agency or organization exactly is responsible for Approbation?

The reason why it is hard to even say is because each state has different type of agency / organization responsible for approbation. Not only that, some states even have *several* different organization for the same task. Here is the complete list:

- Baden-Württemberg - Landesprüfungsamt für Medizin und Pharmazie
- Bayern - Regierung von Oberbayern (Oberbayern/EU/Drittstaaten) + Regierung von Unterfranken
- Berlin - Landesamt für Gesundheit und Soziales
- Brandenburg - Landesamt für Arbeitsschutz, Verbraucherschutz und Gesundheit
- Bremen - Die Senatorin für Wissenschaft, Gesundheit und Verbraucherschutz
- Hamburg - Behörde für Gesundheit und Verbraucherschutz
- Hessen - Hessisches Landesprüfungs- und Untersuchungsamt im Gesundheitswesen
- Mecklenburg- Vorpommern - Landesamt für Gesundheit und Soziales
- Niedersachsen - Niedersächsischer Zweckverband zur Approbationserteilung (NiZza)
- Nordrhein- Westfalen - Bezirksregierung Arnsberg, Detmold, Köln, Düsseldorf or Münster (EU/EWR/Drittstaaten)
- Rheinland-Pfalz - Landesamt für Soziales, Jugend und Versorgung
- Saarland - Landesamt für Soziales Zentralstelle für Gesundheitsberufe und Landesprüfungsamt
- Sachsen - Landesdirektion Sachsen
- Sachsen-Anhalt - Landesverwaltungsamt Sachsen-Anhalt
- Schleswig-Holstein - Landesamt für soziale Dienste

## Is it possible to start my specialist internship before I get my Approbation?

Unfortunately, in most cases, no.

The local medical association most likely will only acknowledge and approve the specialist residency after Approbation. That said, this is something that can be discussed personally with them. Even without recognition, the hospital or attending specialist might approve a de facto residency.
