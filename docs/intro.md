There are myriad of laws, rules and regulations regarding the sending of migrant workers as well as different immigration law in each destination country. These laws and regulation do not stay constant but may change with alarming frequency. To ensure that potential workers can be effectively scouted, trained and sent according to the prevailing regulations the author, Zadi Siregar, deems it necessary to document what have learned so far about sending migrant workers to Austria. 

In time it is hoped that these ridbits of knowledge gathered from research, discussion and consultation may be codified in the form of a standard operating procedure to retain institutional knowledge and assist in onboarding future employee at Tiaramas.
