## Living Document

There are myriad of laws, rules and regulations regarding the sending of migrant workers as well as different immigration law in each destination country. These laws and regulation do not stay constant but may change in alarming frequency.

Therefore the author, Zadi Siregar, deems it necessary to preserve institutional knowledge in Tiaramas Ronagemilang. It is my hope as well that others who come after may learn from we've learned over the years.
