## Austria

On October 1st 2022 [several new laws regulating international skilled workers in Austria](https://www.workinaustria.com/blog/gesetzesreform-zur-rot-weiss-rot-karte-co/) came into effect. These laws make it much easier for Austrian firms to recruit workers from non-EU countries. From the seven or so different type of migrant workers regulated in *Ausländerbeschäftigungsgesetzes* (AusIBG) there are two type of migrant workers that are of interest to Tiaramas.

the most relevant part is in article 12

### Skilled Workers in Sectors struggling with worker shortage

	In German language they are the so called **Fachkräfte in Mangelberufen**. Sectors that chronically short of workers are usually the 3D sectors: dirty, difficult or dangerous jobs. 
	
	In addition to being skilled worker in *Mangelberufen* the prospective migrant workers must  fulfill [additional criterias set by the Austrian governments](/Austria/05%20-%20Points%20Calculator.md) mostly related to Language and Age. Workers fulfilling those criterias and are being offered a job by an Austrian company are eligible to obtain a work visa.This visa is valid for up to two years and may later be extended or converted to more permanent form of permit 

`AusIBG §12a Skilled workers remedying skills shortages in specific occupations.`

`Foreign nationals shall be admitted for employment as skilled workers in jobs suffering from labour shortages as defined in the ordinance for skilled workers (Fachkräfteverordnung, §13), if they`

1. `hold the relevant occupational training credentials`
2. `score the necessary minimum points for the criteria listed in Annex B`
3. `are paid for the intended job the minimum pay rate they are entitled to under`
`law, ordinance or collective agreement plus a supplement as normally agreed`
`at the enterprise in question,`

### Highly qualified workers

	In German they are the so-called **Besonders Hochqualifizierte Arbeitskräfte**. They have much more stringent [requirements](https://www.migration.gv.at/de/formen-der-zuwanderung/dauerhafte-zuwanderung/besonders-hochqualifizierte/) mainly concerning their academic qualifications, age and having previously employed with a high salary. The opportunity to place these highly qualified workers exist but it is likely that we need to first establish a track record of successfully placing the first type of workers first. 


## Indonesia

Due to the many scams and exploitations both by Indonesian employment agencies themselves as well as employers in foreign countries, Indonesia has put forth a deluge of regulations in order to protect its workers. While noble in its intention, Indonesian workers in Europe are hardly ever exploited due to the excellent protection provided by the local governments there both to citizens and non citizens alike. Therefore agencies and workers often get lost in this morass of rules and regulations without the workers deriving much benefit from them.

That said, such is the law of the land and Tiaramas will have to adhere to them.  
Migrant workers in Indonesia are regulated by [UU no 18 2017](https://peraturan.bpk.go.id/Details/64508/uu-no-18-tahun-2017) regarding the Protection of Migrant Workers.  
Some of the more pertinent regulations from this 75 page tome are:

- Article 5 - Workers have to be at least 18 years old 
- Article 6 - Should the workers perish abroad then all his or her belongings should be transferred to his surviving family forthwith
- Article 9 - Job vacancy that is intended to be filled by indonesian migrant workers has to be verified by someone from the Indonesian consulate / embassy. 
- Article 10 - The Indonesian consulate in destination country has to *verify* both the employment agency as well as the company seeking to employ the migrant worker 
- Article 11 - Prospective migrant workers need to have written permission from their spouse or parents. Additionally they also need to have an employment contract
- Article 17 - should the employer seek to extend an indonesian workers contract, the signing has to be done in an indonesian consulate / embassy and verified by the local consul
- Article 25 - Employment Agencies have to keep the Department of Labor as to the whereabouts of Indonesian migrant workers i.e their departure to the country of their destination, their arrival back, if they extend their employment, etc
- Article 27 - Should the migrant worker perishes, the family has to be notified by the employment agency within 72 hours. The agency is also responsible in bringing the body back to Indonesia and take care of all the funeral cost
- Article 30 - Agencies are not allowed extract any fee from the workers
- Article 31 - Workers may only work in countries who has signed an MoU with the Indonesian government.
- Article 63 - "Pekerja Migran Indonesia Perseorangan dapat bekerja ke luar negeri pada Pemberi Kerja berbadan hukum."
  
  As written article 63 actually allows anyone to apply and work abroad without having to go through any employment agency hence obviating its need. This is likely to provide legal leeway to highly qualified workers such as programmers and doctors who would consider it demeaning to be grouped as migrant workers (TKI). TKI is a term which has a negative connotation attached to it, mainly to it being used to refer to low skilled workers such as domestic helpers.

:::warning

Indonesian employment agencies are repeatedly warned to not impose **any** fee from the migrant workers themselves. This creates a mismatch during the language training process which may take up to one year or even more. Need to find ways to ameliorate the risk.
