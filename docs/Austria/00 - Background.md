# Background

On May 13th 2024 PT Tiaramas Ronagemilang was invited by the Indonesian Department of Labor to attend a seminar introducing several talent agencies from Austria. The company has had experience in helping Indonesian workers specifically nurses and doctors find employment in Germany and so was very interested to see if it can expand its business.

The Indonesian government recently introduced a new law prohibiting migrant workers from taking up employment abroad unless said employment is managed both by an Indonesian Worker Agency in cooperation with a similar agency based in the destination country. The main objective of said law is to make sure that there are people who can be held legally responsible should anything untoward happens to said Indonesian migrant workers.

Similar to other prosperous countries in Europe, Austria is struggling with aging society (20% of the population is over 65) and companies are progressively finding it more difficult to fill vacant positions. On the other hand, recently the Indonesian Bureau of Statistics published its finding where it found that over **ten million** Indonesian GenZ neither work nor attend school.  These so called youth not in education, employment aka NEET is a ticking time bomb that needs to be addressed forthwith.

Should Tiaramas be able to find the young, motivated, intelligent, diligent and honest workers, they would be prime candidates to fill positions in Austrian companies that have been left vacant for years.
