# To Apply for Indonesian Passport

Documents required for workers to be able to apply for passport are as follows:

- KTP
- Kartu Keluarga
- Akte Kelahiran

Some immigration offices are much more lenient in granting passport while others are much tougher. Immigration offices in major tourist destinations like Bali are usually easier. If all else fails, we can leverage our connection at the Cirebon Immigration Office where we can grease the hands of the immigration officers.

Check [this step-by-step guide](https://news.detik.com/berita/d-6558813/cara-membuat-paspor-baru-online-beserta-syarat-dan-biayanya) on how to apply for a passport. 

:::warning

Most likely prospective workers will NOT be able to simply apply and receive a passport. Indonesian civil servants are always on the lookout for opportunities for shakedowns. Migrant workers often come from the lower class or minorities. Additionally these workers are hoping for dramatic increase in their income by working abroad. They are prime target for shakedowns. 

Often the fastest way is simply to bribe those civil servants, which is what they want in the first place. But that could be VERY costly. Long term solutions are still needed.
