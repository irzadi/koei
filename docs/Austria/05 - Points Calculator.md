## The Red-White-Red – Card for  Skilled Workers in Shortage Occupations



To be able to apply for Visa as "Skilled Worker in Occupations with Labor Shortage" a prospective migrant is assessed in various criteries. At least 55 points is required to even apply for a visa. Obviously the more the better the chance that a visa is given. Fulfilling just the minimum requirements likely does not guarantee a visa.

The Red-White-Red - Card for Skilled Workers in Shortage Occupations is  aimed at third-country nationals who have a job offer and training in a  shortage occupation.

Every year, the Federal Republic of Austria publishes a list of  shortage occupations. This term refers to those occupations for which  less than 1.5 job seekers per vacancy were available within a year. The  Skilled Workers Ordinance, issued annually by the Federal Ministry of  Labor and Economy, brings an historic high of shortage occupations in  2024, which are divided into [nationwide ](https://workinaustria.com/en/residence-employment/shortage-occupations/nationwide)(110) and [regional ](https://workinaustria.com/en/residence-employment/shortage-occupations/nationwide#c9605)(48) shortage occupations.

Skilled workers from these occupational groups can usually immigrate  to Austria somewhat more quickly. This is mainly due to the fact that it is already established in advance that there is a demand for these  skilled workers on the labour market and thus no labour market check is  carried out.

In order to receive this Red-White-Red – Card, you have to attain a sufficient number of points in the legally [stipulated points system](https://www.workinaustria.com/en/living-working/working-in-austria/point-scheme#c4682).

There are **several categories** of criteria in which you can collect points:

### Qualifications (training or education in a shortage occupation)

You will only receive points for your education or studies if they match  the job offer in the shortage occupation. For example, if you have  received a job offer as a software developer, a degree in philosophy  will not be sufficiently relevant to the profession. The training you  have completed must largely correspond to the Austrian level of training in terms of duration and scope.

Professional experience which you gained in your specialised area after your studies or training

Not only fully completed years of **professional experience** will count, but also periods of 6 months. Internships and self-employed work are generally **not** taken into account. **Proof** of professional experience must include, at a minimum, the starting date,  the end date, and a description of the job position.  

### Language skills

**German Language certificates** must not be older than 5 years when you apply for the Red-White-Red – Card.  German certificates from the following institutions are accepted: ÖSD,  Goethe-Institute, TELC, Austrian Integration Fund (ÖIF). 

**English Language certificates** must not be older than 5 years when you apply for the Red-White-Red –  Card. English certificates are accepted from the following institutions: [Cambridge](https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/), The European Language Certificates (TELC), International English Language Testing  System (IELTS), Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC), Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). You will receive 5 **additional points** for demonstrable English proficiency if the **company language** is English.

### Age

You will obtain points for the **age** you are upon submission of the application.
