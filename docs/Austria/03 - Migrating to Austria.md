Many of the information below are provided by ABA, an Austrian government agency with portfolio in helping prospective migrant workers. Specifically [this page](https://immigration-guide.workinaustria.com/de/nicht-eu-ewr/arbeiten/langfristiger-aufenthalt/) is very useful. 

# Finding a job

To be able to migrate to Austria, a visa is needed. And to be able to secure a work visa, one must first have a job offer from an Austrian company. Therefore Tiaramas might first look around for a job vacancy that suits the prospective migrant worker from Indonesia.

[The website **Working in Austria** does provide a list of jobs ](https://jobs.workinaustria.com/jobs?lang=de) specifically for migrant workers. However these are quite focused on IT and Engineering.

Austrian [employment agencies](./04%20-%20Austrian%20Agencies.md) can help with identifying companies willing to employ Indonesian workers.  In any case the Indonesian government only allows migrant workers who is facilitated by BOTH the Indonesian as well as Austrian agencies. Therefore even if Tiaramas were able to contact and connect Indonesian workers directly with the Austrian companies, it would not be of much benefit.
