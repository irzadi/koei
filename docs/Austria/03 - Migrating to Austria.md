Many of the information below are provided by ABA, an Austrian government agency with portfolio in helping prospective migrant workers. Specifically [this page](https://immigration-guide.workinaustria.com/de/nicht-eu-ewr/arbeiten/langfristiger-aufenthalt/) is very useful. 

# Finding a job

To be able to migrate to Austria, a visa is needed. And to be able to secure a work visa, one must first have a job offer from an Austrian company. Therefore Tiaramas might first look around for a job vacancy that suits the prospective migrant worker from Indonesia.

[The website **Working in Austria** does provide a list of jobs ](https://jobs.workinaustria.com/jobs?lang=de) specifically for migrant workers. However these are quite focused on IT and Engineering.

Another option is to contact Austrian [employment agencies](./04%20-%20Austrian%20Agencies.md) with whom we can partner with. 

# Preparing to apply for a Visa

Once a worker has applied for a job and received a job offer, the next step is to apply for a visa. Use the [following link](https://immigration-guide.workinaustria.com/de/nicht-eu-ewr/arbeiten/langfristiger-aufenthalt/bereiten-sie-den-antrag-vor) to check what kind of visa the worker should be applying for. Afterwards the documents for that specific visa will be listed.
