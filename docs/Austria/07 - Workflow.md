# Signing of MoU with an Austrian recruitment agency

According to Indonesian law, Tiaramas cannot directly help Austrian companies to hire Indonesian workers. Recruitment has to be done Tiaramas and later handed off to the Austrian recruitment agency before the workers finally work at the intended company. Therefore the very first step is to find a reliable and reputable partner with whom Tiaramas can form a long term strategic partnership.

First we will need to sign the MoU with our intended Austrian partner. [An example of such MoU can be found here](../resources/Tiaramas MoU draft.docx). Note that the draft is of an MoU successfully approved by Indonesian embassy in Malaysia and Madagascar. Therefore the MoU might need to  first be revised to be in compliance with Austrian laws.

# Austrian partner apply for approval

This MoU will then need to be taken by our partner to the Indonesian Embassy at Vienna. An embassy staff  will then conduct a verification process to ensure that our partner is a reputable recruitment agency. 

Given Indonesian civil servant tendencies to avoid work and avoid responsibilities as well as the lack of coordination between the Indonesian Dept of Labour and the State Department, the process might likely to be stalled here. We will need to work closely with our Austrian partner. From Indonesia we could coordinate with the Dept of Labour to assist with the Embassy in Vienna in ensuring the MoU's approval.

# Identifying the most lucrative opportunities

The list of [jobs requiring workers](02%20-%20List%20of%20Mangelberufe.md) might be long, but we should really identify several jobs that we can focus on to be our core competency. Note that during language training we might have to teach our trainee technical terms related to their future jobs. Therefore having jobs from too many different categories could impair language learning.

By restricting ourselves to several most enticing jobs, we can also cut down cost of marketing and recruitment. Our Austrian partner is also unlikely to be able to conduct extensive touring to many different universities in Indonesia.

# Work with Austrian partner to recruit workers

Indonesian workers and their families are very skeptical of Indonesian recruitment agencies. They have no capabilities to conduct research and therefore has very little idea which agency is reputable and which is not. Recruitment will be one of our biggest hurdles. The best workers will already have a job, the ones with potential are skeptical and at first only the worst, people who for many reasons have been long unemployed and thus are desperate, will actively seek us.

To recruit the best workers i.e. fresh graduates from elite universities or experienced workers with good prospect in Indonesia we will need our Austrian partner to assist us. Some of the ways that are often useful to generate leads :

- A short video to introduce Austria and the reason why they're recruiting.
- A zoom conference with interested parties
- Should we are able to generate enough leads i.e. at least 30 or so a seminar might be held at universities or nursing/trade schools.

# German language training

By far the longest, the most expensive and most uncertain part of recruitment.

Lessons learned over the years:

- Many trainee will have relatively bad learning habits. Needs to be addressed immediately.
- Language learning is **very ineffective**. Language acquisition needs to be encouraged. We will need to acquire more comics or A1 and A2 level books / magazines. Solutions might be found through digital comic books.
- Need to ensure that at least some trainee in the classroom are high achiever. Serve as role models for the others.
- Monthly check by Austrian agencies / companies to motivate trainee. Reminding them why they are doing this.
- How the language training should be financed is an ongoing problem. Trainee will balk at paying for it, many will simply opt to decide against migrating to Austria. Tiaramas paying for the language training creates a huge moral hazard risk, workers may opt to train with Tiaramas and in the end work in Austria or Germany through other agency or apply individually.

| Prospective workers take out loans from Indonesian banks     | Doable but will need massive help from the Ministry of Labour to convince the banks. Workers unlikely to have collateral.  Parents and workers will also need to be conviced that this is not a scam. |
| Provide language training to third parties as additional source of revenue | Teachers might be overwhelmed with work. Teachers might favor third parties as they often come from more affluent background. Migrant workers could be neglected. |
