# Signing of MoU with an Austrian recruitment agency

According to Indonesian law, Tiaramas can directly help Austrian companies to hire Indonesian workers, subsequently via Austrian Recruitment Agencies. Recruitment has to be done by Tiaramas and later the workers are to be introduced and handled directly by Austrian Companies or through recruitment agency who will facilitate their transfers to the intended company in Austria.

Therefore the very first step is to find a reliable and reputable partner with whom Tiaramas can form a long term strategic partnership.

Should be parties are amenable to a partnership, an MoU will be drafted and signed. [An example of such MoU can be found here](/img/Tiaramas MoU draft.docx). The signed MoU will then need to be examined and approved to by the Indonesian embassy where workers are intended to be placed. 

# Austrian partner apply for approval

Our Austrian partner is to take the signed MoU to the Indonesian Embassy in Vienna. An embassy staff  will then conduct a verification process to ensure that our partner is a reputable recruitment agency. 

:::warning
Given Indonesian civil servants tendencies to avoid work and avoid responsibilities in addition to the inadequate coordination between the Indonesian Dept of Labour and the State Department, the verification process is quite likely to stall. Sometimes the embassy staff simply do not know what they are supposed to do and to save face, instead of admitting it they simply let the application lie dormant. We will need to assist our Austrian partner with the verification e.g. we could ask our contacts at the Dept of Labour to assist the Embassy in Vienna in the approval and verification process.

# Identifying the most lucrative opportunities

The list of [jobs requiring workers](02%20-%20List%20of%20Mangelberufe.md) might be long, but we should really identify several jobs that we can focus on to be our core competency. Note that during language training we might have to teach our trainee technical terms related to their future jobs. Therefore having jobs from too many different categories could impair language learning.

By restricting ourselves to several most enticing jobs, we can also cut down cost of marketing and recruitment. Our Austrian partner is also unlikely to be able to conduct extensive touring to many different universities in Indonesia.

# Work with Austrian partner to recruit workers

Indonesian workers and their families are very skeptical of Indonesian recruitment agencies. They have no capabilities to conduct research and therefore has very little idea which agency is reputable and which is not. Recruitment will be one of our biggest hurdles. The best workers will already have a job, the ones with potential are skeptical and at first only the worst, people who for many reasons have been long unemployed and thus are desperate, will actively seek us.

To recruit the best workers i.e. fresh graduates from elite universities or experienced workers with good prospect in Indonesia we will need our Austrian partner to assist us. Some of the ways that are often useful to generate leads :

- A short video to introduce Austria and the reason why they're recruiting.
- A zoom conference with interested parties
- Should we are able to generate enough leads i.e. at least 30 or so a seminar might be held at universities or nursing/trade schools.

# German language training

By far the longest, the most expensive and most uncertain part of recruitment.

Lessons learned over the years:

- Many trainee will have relatively bad learning habits. Needs to be addressed immediately.
- Language learning is **very ineffective**. Language acquisition needs to be encouraged. We will need to acquire more comics or A1 and A2 level books / magazines. Solutions might be found through digital comic books.
- Need to ensure that at least some trainee in the classroom are high achiever. Serve as role models for the others.
- Monthly check by Austrian agencies / companies to motivate trainee. Reminding them why they are doing this.
- How the language training should be financed is an ongoing problem. Trainee will balk at paying for it, many will simply opt to decide against migrating to Austria. Tiaramas paying for the language training creates a huge moral hazard risk, workers may opt to train with Tiaramas and in the end work in Austria or Germany through other agency or apply individually.

| Prospective workers take out loans from Indonesian banks     | Doable but will need massive help from the Ministry of Labour to convince the banks. Workers unlikely to have collateral.  Parents and workers will also need to be conviced that this is not a scam. |
| Provide language training to third parties as additional source of revenue | Teachers might be overwhelmed with work. Teachers might favor third parties as they often come from more affluent background. Migrant workers could be neglected. |
